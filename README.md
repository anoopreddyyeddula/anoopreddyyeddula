I'm passionate about __Machine Learning__, __Data Analysis__, __Large Language Models (LLMs)__ and __Generative AI__. 

<h2> 👨‍🎓🙋‍♂️ About Me 💼🎒: </h2>

I hold a Masters Degree in Computer Science at [__Portland State University__](https://www.pdx.edu/).

I have *2+ years* of experience as a __Data Analyst__ at __Hudl__. 

Furthermore, I have a strong practical and theoretical experience in the development of __machine learning__, __deep learning models__, __Large Language Models (LLMs)__ and __Generative AI__.

🔭 Some of the notable courses I have completed and that helped in gaining strong theoretical foundation include: 
* *Create ML Models with BigQuery ML Certification by [__Google__](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en)*
* *Prepare Data for ML APIs on Google Cloud by [__Google__](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en)*
* *Build and Deploy Machine Learning Solutions on Vertex AI by [__Google__](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en)*
* *Develop GenAI Apps with Gemini and Streamlit by [__Google__](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en)*
* *Inspect Rich Documents with Gemini Multimodality and Multimodal RAG by [__Google__](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en)*
* *Prompt Design in Vertex AI by [__Google__](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en)*
* *Deploy Kubernetes Applications on Google Cloud by [__Google__](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en)*
* *AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner by [__Amazon Web Services Training and Certification__](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/)*

🔭 I've used different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in real-time projects. Below are some used models:

* *Linear Regression*
* *Logistic Regression*
* *Support Vector Machines (SVM)*
* *Decision Trees (DT)*
* *Random Forests (RF)*
* *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*
* *Deep Neural Networks*
* *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)*
* *Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)*
* *Naive Bayes (NB)*
* *Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)*
* *XGBoost*
* *Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)*

🔭 Here are some of the __Generative AI__ tools I have experience with:

* *Langchain*
* *LangGraph*
* *Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)*
* *Llama Index*
* *OpenAI API*
* *Mixtral (LLM)*
* *Llama 2 (LLM)*
* *GPT - 3 (LLM)*
* *GPT - 3.5 (LLM)*
* *GPT - 4 (LLM)*

🔭 Here are some of the __DevOps__ technologies I have experience with:

* *Docker*
* *Docker-Compose*
* *Kubernetes*
* *Linux*
* *Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)*
* *Travis CI*
* *Ubuntu*
* *GitLab CI/CD*

<h2>🪚🔧 My Skills 😀😀:</h2>

These valuable tools and techniques have empowered me to successfully develop and comprehend intricate many projects.
