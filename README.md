### Hi there, This is Anoop Reddyüëã

I'm passionate about __Machine Learning__, __Data Analysis__, __Large Language Models (LLMs)__ and __Generative AI__. 

<h2> üë®‚Äçüéìüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me üíºüéí: </h2>

I hold a Masters Degree in Computer Science at [__Portland State University__](https://www.pdx.edu/).

I have *2+ years* of experience as a __Data Analyst__ at __Hudl__. 

Furthermore, I have a strong practical and theoretical experience in the development of __machine learning__, __deep learning models__, __Large Language Models (LLMs)__ and __Generative AI__.

üî≠ Some of the notable courses I have completed and that helped in gaining strong theoretical foundation include: 
* *Create ML Models with BigQuery ML Certification by [__Google__](https://www.credly.com/badges/153edab1-8cd4-4f18-a353-9c368833da3f/linked_in_profile)*
* *Prepare Data for ML APIs on Google Cloud by [__Google__](https://www.credly.com/badges/084e4068-efb9-4fdb-90ea-790b86cf695e/linked_in_profile)*
* *Build and Deploy Machine Learning Solutions on Vertex AI by [__Google__](https://www.credly.com/badges/8b18dd24-eb9b-4ab6-8792-672264d34905/linked_in_profile)*
* *Develop GenAI Apps with Gemini and Streamlit by [__Google__](https://www.credly.com/badges/832cdfd4-48b6-4293-9f50-b63047bf49ae/linked_in_profile)*
* *Inspect Rich Documents with Gemini Multimodality and Multimodal RAG by [__Google__](https://www.credly.com/badges/d59cb5ba-d9dd-47fc-82d7-7772ccc4c6be/linked_in_profile)*
* *Prompt Design in Vertex AI by [__Google__](https://www.credly.com/badges/5dd6da70-e49d-49c9-b0e3-08e6a58a7a04/linked_in_profile)*
* *Deploy Kubernetes Applications on Google Cloud by [__Google__](https://www.credly.com/badges/bd5b1404-837a-4f00-b015-7f714f3098fe/linked_in_profile)*
* *AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner by [__Amazon Web Services Training and Certification__](https://www.credly.com/badges/66675cbd-aeaf-43cb-9a73-64cad69f1711/linked_in_profile)*

üî≠ I've used different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in real-time projects. Below are some used models:

* *Linear Regression*
* *Logistic Regression*
* *Support Vector Machines (SVM)*
* *Decision Trees (DT)*
* *Random Forests (RF)*
* *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*
* *Deep Neural Networks*
* *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)*
* *Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)*
* *Naive Bayes (NB)*
* *Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)*
* *XGBoost*
* *Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)*

üî≠ Furthermore, below are some of the tools used during my experience for __Generative AI__:

* *Langchain*
* *LangGraph*
* *Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)*
* *Llama Index*
* *OpenAI API*
* *Mixtral (LLM)*
* *Llama 2 (LLM)*
* *GPT - 3 (LLM)*
* *GPT - 3.5 (LLM)*
* *GPT - 4 (LLM)*
